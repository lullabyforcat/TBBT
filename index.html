                        <p>Originally from Galveston, Texas, Sheldon was a child prodigy with an eidetic memory who
                            began college at the age of eleven and earned a Ph.D. at age sixteen. He is a theoretical
                            physicist researching quantum mechanics and string theory, and, despite his IQ of 187, he
                            finds many routine aspects of social situations difficult to grasp. He is determined to have
                            his own way, continually boasts of his intelligence, and has an extremely ritualized way of
                            living. Despite these quirks, he begins a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler, and they
                            eventually marry.</p>

        <h2>Theme song</h2>
        <p>The Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes
            the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer Ed Robertson was asked by Lorre and
            Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los
            Angeles. Coincidentally, Robertson had recently read Simon Singh's book Big Bang,[53][54] and at the concert
            he improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.[55] Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly
            thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and
            shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to
            write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.</p>
