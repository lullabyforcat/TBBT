                        <h2>Howard Wolowitz</h2>
                        <p>An aerospace engineer who got his master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of
                            Technology. Howard is Jewish and lived with his mother, Debbie (Carol Ann Susi). Unlike
                            Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, Bernadette, and Amy, Howard does not hold a doctorate. He trains
                            as
                            an astronaut and goes into space as a payload specialist on the International Space
                            Station.
                            Howard initially fancies himself as a ladies man, but he later starts dating Bernadette,
                            and
                            they get engaged and married. Howard also has a tendency to waste money on toys and
                            argues
                            with Bernadette because of his oddly low income as an engineer and her high income as a
                            pharmaceutical biochemist.</p>

                        <h2>Rajesh Koothrappali</h2>
                        <p>A particle astrophysicist originally from New Delhi, India. Initially, Raj had selective
                            mutism, rendering him unable to talk to or be around women unless under the influence of
                            alcohol. Raj also has very feminine tastes and often takes on a stereotypical female
                            role in
                            his friendship with Howard as well as in the group of four men. Raj later dates Lucy
                            (Kate
                            Micucci), who also suffers from social anxiety, but it eventually ends. He later speaks
                            to
                            Penny without alcohol, overcoming his selective mutism. He begins dating Emily Sweeney,
                            and
                            their relationship later becomes exclusive. In the series' final season, Raj has an
                            on-again, off-again engagement with a fellow Indian, a hotel concierge named Anu (Rati
                            Gupta). He also has a Yorkshire Terrier named Cinnamon, given by Howard and Bernadette.
